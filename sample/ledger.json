  "title": "Grounds: ship a public demo",
  "context": "We want a premium-looking demo that generates a decision-grade report people can share. The product should avoid domain-specific language and work globally. The UI should feel alive: micro-motion, hover color shifts, and calm typography.",
  "intent": "Build a v0.1 that reliably produces a polished HTML report and optional PDF export. Include 2026-ready signals (half-life, blind spots, perspective shift) without sounding robotic.",
  "options": [
    "Ship minimal: one page + simple report",
    "Ship full: report + ledger export + 2026 signals",
    "Delay: polish longer and risk never shipping"
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "People want a short briefing, not a wall of text",
    "A transparent heuristic score is enough for an MVP",
    "Offline HTML reports are universally shareable"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Scope creep: adding too much too early",
    "UI feels like a dashboard instead of a premium brief",
    "Report reads generic (not decision-grade)"
  ],
  "evidence": [
    "A complete report template with consistent tone",
    "Deterministic scoring rules (readiness, half-life, blind spots)",
    "A clear set of lenses for perspective shift"
