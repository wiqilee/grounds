## 🎯 What is Grounds?

**Grounds** is a **decision intelligence workspace** that helps you think better, not faster.

In a world where AI can generate endless opinions, Grounds takes a different approach: **it doesn't tell you what to decide—it helps you see your decision clearly.**

> *"A mirror, not a verdict."*

### ⚡ The Problem

Every day, professionals face high-stakes decisions across every industry:

| Industry | Example Decision |
|----------|-----------------|
| 👔 **Business** | A CEO choosing between acquisition targets or crisis response strategies |
| 🏥 **Healthcare** | A hospital board deciding on AI-assisted diagnosis adoption |
| ⚖️ **Legal** | A law firm choosing between AI tools and human-only positioning |

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Explicit beats clever** | Every decision is visible and auditable |
| 📐 **Structure beats persuasion** | Frameworks over opinions |
| ⏳ **Decisions should age well** | Still makes sense 6 months later |
| 🤝 **AI assists, human decides** | Tools, not oracles |
| 📊 **Data-driven insights** | Quantify uncertainty, visualize relationships |

---

## 🚫 What Grounds Is NOT

| ❌ | Description |
|----|-------------|
| 🚫 | Not a legal/financial/medical advisor |
| 🚫 | Not a recommendation engine |
| 🚫 | Not an "AI decides for you" tool |
| 🚫 | Not a chatbot |

Grounds is a **thinking surface**, not an authority.
